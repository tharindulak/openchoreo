"""MCP server exposing rca-agent capabilities to upstream LLM agents.

Mounted as a sub-app at ``/mcp`` on the FastAPI app in main.py. Speaks the
streamable HTTP MCP transport — same wire protocol the openchoreo-api
control-plane and the observer plane already expose, so the existing
``langchain-mcp-adapters`` client used by assistant-agent connects without
any new code.

Auth flow:
    1. ASGI middleware validates ``Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`` on every
       request (Initialize / tools/list / tools/call). Same JWKS validation
       and claim mapping as the FastAPI REST routes (`require_authn`).
    2. The middleware stashes the validated ``SubjectContext`` and bearer
       token in contextvars so each tool can:
         - re-authorize against the platform PDP (rcareport:view / :update)
           with the user's own bearer, AND
         - attribute background work (analyze_runtime_state's run_analysis
           coroutine) back to the caller in logs.
    3. Each tool calls ``_authorize`` with the action it needs and the
       project hierarchy it is about to touch — the SAME action constants
       the REST routes use, so a deny here matches a deny on /reports/*.

Streaming: this module uses a *pure ASGI* middleware (not
``BaseHTTPMiddleware``) because the MCP streamable-HTTP transport sends
SSE-style chunked responses; ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` buffers the entire
body before forwarding and would either deadlock or block the stream.

    #   1. ``mcp>=1.23.0`` is pinned in pyproject.toml. Pre-1.23 the SDK
    #      had a different default for this flag and a different set of
    #      transport-layer mitigations.

    #      external HTTPRoute. Only the in-cluster Service is reachable.
    #      See install/helm/.../templates/rca-agent/httproute.yaml — it
    #      must NOT include a /mcp path match for the public gateway.
    #   3. NetworkPolicy (or equivalent) restricts ingress to ``/mcp`` to
    #      the assistant-agent ServiceAccount / Pod selector.
