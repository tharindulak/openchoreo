    Detection is intentionally heuristic so this works uniformly across MCP
    servers — including third-party MCPs we adopt later that won't carry an
    OpenChoreo-specific server-side flag. The decision is:

      1. Explicit READ_OVERRIDES win (returns False).
      2. Name prefix or substring matches a write verb → True.
      3. Name prefix matches a read verb → False. **This runs before the
         description-keyword fallback** because a description like
         "applies filtering" or "triggers a search" tripped the keyword
         fallback for clearly read-only ``query_*`` tools, refusing them
         as mutations at WriteGuard time and burning two ~30s LLM
         round-trips per turn.
      4. Description-keyword fallback → True (only reaches here for
         names with no prefix in either set, e.g. ``analyze_*``).
      5. Default to True on ambiguity. The failure mode of a false
         positive is "user is asked to confirm a read"; the failure
         mode of a false negative is "agent silently writes without
         preview." The asymmetry justifies erring toward confirmation.

    See also: services.ErrDryRunNotSupported on the Go side — even if the agent
    decides a tool is mutating and dry-runs it, the underlying service may not
    yet support dry-run, in which case it returns the typed error rather than
    silently executing.
