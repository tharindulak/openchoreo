- ``stream_chat`` — runs one chat turn end-to-end and yields NDJSON
  StreamEvents.
- the streaming-loop helpers (``_yield_chunks``,
  ``_recover_from_structured_response``, ``_handle_stream_error``).
- the per-pod concurrency semaphore.

agent is read-only: there is no action proposal / approval / execute
