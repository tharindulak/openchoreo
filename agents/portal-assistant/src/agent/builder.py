"""Compiles the LangChain agent for one chat turn.

Owns:
- per-case recursion-limit caps + tool allowlists,
- the cached system-prompt render (which also computes per-tool
  required-field maps and the rca-available flag),
- the agent assembly itself (model + tools + middleware + structured
  output).

Pulled out of the old ``agent.py`` so the streaming orchestrator can
import a single, well-scoped factory. No behaviour change vs. the
pre-split implementation — this is a file-move only.

# Per-case recursion-limit cap. langgraph's ``recursion_limit`` counts graph
# supersteps — each model call + each tool node visit ticks the counter.
# A single-tool turn ≈ 3 supersteps; a 3-tool turn ≈ 7. Capping per-case
# guarantees worst-case per-turn latency: even if the model loops on a
# tool, the graph hard-stops at the cap and emits a final answer.
#
# Default 30 (the langgraph default we used everywhere before per-case caps)
# is preserved for unknown / missing case_type so the generic FAB and any
# future case keep working without code change.

# langgraph counts every node visit, not every model call. With 5
# middleware nodes (Logging / LoopGuard / EmptyResultGuard /
# WriteGuard / ToolErrorHandler) + agent node + tool node, one tool
# cycle is roughly 4-6 supersteps. So the per-case caps below
# translate to:
#   build_failure (15)  ≈ 3 tool cycles + final reply, ~5 supersteps
#                         of headroom over the observed max from a
#                         2026-05-15 N=5 bench (build_failure with 3
#                         tools occasionally needs 11+ supersteps).
#   runtime_debug (15)  ≈ 3 tool cycles + final reply, more headroom
#                         because the path lacks build_failure's
#                         Phase A discovery step.
# (EmptyResultGuard short-circuits the empty-data loop separately, so
#  this cap is the safety net for non-empty-but-unproductive iteration.)
#
# Operators can override the per-case map globally via the
# ``PORTAL_ASSISTANT_RECURSION_LIMIT`` env var (chart value
# ``portalAssistant.config.recursionLimit``). When that env var is non-zero
# it wins over both ``_DEFAULT_RECURSION_LIMIT`` and the map below.

# Per-case tool allowlists. The MCP catalog ships ~100 tools across the

# models to loop on unrelated read tools. Per-case filtering keeps the
# agent narrowly focused: the build-failure flow doesn't see component
# create tools, the create flow doesn't see log queries, etc.
#
# Conventions:
# - Set is the EXACT tool name (no glob). Names of tools that don't exist
#   in the current MCP catalog are silently ignored at filter time.
# - Add a tool here only if a prompt block actually instructs the agent
#   to call it.
# - Unknown / missing case_type → no filtering (full catalog), so the
