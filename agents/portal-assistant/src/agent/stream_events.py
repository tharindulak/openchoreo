"""Typed wire-format events for the /chat ndjson stream.

The chat endpoint streams one JSON object per line. Historically these
events were assembled inline as anonymous dicts (``emit({"type": ...})``)
in agent.py — the exact shape lived in code comments, the frontend
consumed it from memory, and shape drift between the two had to be
caught by manual testing.

This module makes the wire format explicit:

  - Each event is a Pydantic ``BaseModel`` with a literal ``type`` field
    that discriminates the union. Adding a new event = adding a class +
    extending the union.
  - ``emit(event)`` serialises to a newline-terminated JSON line — the
    one place that decides exactly what bytes leave the server.
  - The frontend's TypeScript ``StreamEvent`` type can be regenerated
    from these models (or hand-mirrored) with confidence that fields and
    field-names match.

Backward compatibility: the JSON shape is unchanged. Existing frontends
that already understand ``{"type": "message_chunk", ...}`` etc. continue
to work — this is a server-side typing exercise, not a wire change.
