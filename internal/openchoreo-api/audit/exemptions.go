// Exhaustive, reads included: the coverage gate (mcphandlers'
// TestAuditCoverage) fails for an operation that is neither defined nor listed
// here, so a new endpoint cannot go unaudited by nobody noticing. Reads are
// listed rather than inferred from the method because the method is not a
// reliable proxy either way — Evaluates is a POST that reads, and GetSecret is
// a GET that might be worth auditing.
//
// GenerateRelease is NOT here: it persists a new ComponentRelease via
// k8sClient.Create (see ComponentService.GenerateRelease), so it has a real
// definition (generatedOperationDefs' generateReleaseOverride) instead.
