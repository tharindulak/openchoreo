// NewUnauthenticatedMiddleware returns the outer HTTP audit adapter. It must
// wrap the auth middleware, not sit inside it: auth short-circuits a
// rejected request with its own response and never calls next, so the inner
// pattern-map-driven Middleware never runs on an auth failure. This is the
// only place that gap can be closed.
//
// It emits exactly one event, with a nil Operation and Result:
// ResultUnauthenticated, when the response status is 401 and the inner
// Middleware did not already emit for this request. Every other outcome
// emits nothing: a 403 PDP denial, or a 401 the inner Middleware itself
// recorded against a resolved operation, are both events the inner instance
// already owns.
//
// Mutual exclusivity is tracked via emittedMarker rather than by checking
// auth.GetSubjectContextFromContext(r.Context()) after next.ServeHTTP
// returns: that read would always see no subject regardless of whether auth
// succeeded, since auth (and the inner Middleware) attach the subject to a
// *derived* request via r.WithContext, and that derived request never
// propagates back to the r this closure captured. See emittedMarker's doc
// comment.
//
// A panic is audited the same way a status code is classified — as a
// failure, but only when the inner Middleware hasn't already recorded one;
// double-emitting the same panic on both would be worse than the asymmetry
// it would otherwise leave (a panic in auth itself, or between the two
// middlewares, going unaudited).
//
// origin stamps the surface the rejected request was aimed at. It is a
// parameter rather than a constant because the same middleware guards more
// than one surface: the generated REST routes and the exec/wirelogs routes
// are SurfaceREST, while /mcp is SurfaceMCP. Without it every MCP token
// rejection would be recorded as if it had arrived over REST.
//
// The event it emits carries a nil Operation, so Action, Category,
// OperationID and ResourceType are all empty (see buildEvent) and every
// operation-derived policy selector short-circuits on them (see
// Selector.matches). A rejection is therefore selectable only by origins,
// results, actor_types and actors — on either surface.
