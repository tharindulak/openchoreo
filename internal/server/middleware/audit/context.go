// Last write wins, deliberately, with no guard against an earlier call. A
// single request can trigger more than one Check — e.g. a handler resolving
// a referenced object through another authz-wrapped service (itself doing
// its own Check) before running its own — and an earlier "first write wins"
// rule here permanently locked in whichever precondition check happened to
// run first, silently losing the actual operation's hierarchy.
//
// Last-wins is safe because of a structural fact, not an assumption: every
// *ServiceWithAuthz wrapper calls its own Check before delegating to the
// unwrapped implementation, so any precondition lookup's Check necessarily
// completes before the outer method reaches its own. That makes the last
// Check in a request reliably the one for the operation actually being
// audited (confirmed by tracing both REST and MCP requests).
//
// This depends on every wrapped service calling the unwrapped Service
// directly rather than another wrapper's method after its own Check — the
// convention component/service_authz.go documents. If that's ever violated,
// the later call's hierarchy would win instead, the same failure mode
// inverted, and worth revisiting if observed.

// and FilteredList's per-item checks (routed through BatchCheck, deliberately
